# BankSim-PySpark
I evaluated the performance of the random forest and logistic regression  classifiers in detection of fraudulent transactions in the BankSim dataset using PySpark, and compared the results with each other as well  as with past fraud-related research done in Apache Spark. With numerical indexing of categorical features, the logistic regression classifier underperformed  the random forest classifier on the oversampled train dataframe, in particular in the area under PR metric. However, after one-hot encoding the logistic regression classifier outperformed the random forest classifier both on the oversampled and the undersampled train dataframes, especially in the area under PR metric.
