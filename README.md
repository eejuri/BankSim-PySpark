# BankSim-PySpark
In my courseworkat the Univerity of London I evaluated the performance of the random forest and logistic regression classifiers in detection of fraudulent transactions in the BankSim dataset using PySpark, and compared the results with each other as well as with past fraud-related research done in Apache Spark. Both the random forest classifier and the logistic regression classifier scored the best accuracies of around 99%, something expected for a highly imbalanced dataset and similar to past fraud-related research results in Apache Spark. More importantly, the random forest classifier’s best score in the area under PR metric came slightly above the logistic regression classifier’s one, with both classifiers’ scores indicating their decent ability to identify fraud.
